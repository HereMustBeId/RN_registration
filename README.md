React Native two Autorization screens with phone and passwrod inputs

<pre>
The first screen use default custom num pad
The logic of work is obvious -> user enter his (her) phone number, 
then component send it to back-end (using apollo and graphql) and flips the user to password page.

When user get password on his phone, he paste it in application password screen.
If everything is ok - he will be fliped to the main application page.
</pre>

How it looks like:
